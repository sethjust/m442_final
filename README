This project is meant to provide a distributed Python compute service. This
repository currently contains only elements of the central distributed object
store, written in C.

The architecture of this store is a network of peer servers with some (as yet
undecided) way of knowing about its peers. This code implements communication
between servers via socket connections. Each server listens on a socket and
sequentially accepts connections (hopefully this will become threaded at some
point). Each connection is a series of two way string exchanges of the
following format: first the connecting peer sends "COMMAND{:data}*" and the
server responds with "[ACK|NACK]{:data}*". In both cases the data formatting is
determined by the command sent.
